## jph_sandbox

For saving cool bits of code and improving on it.

####Milk Pricing:
Draws a map of Wisconsin and then colors counties by a certain value.  Better than ARC since it is interactive.

Needed improvements:
- Make one map that switches between multiple layers.  Should also change the histogram too.
- Have it handle the GIS nodes of islands better.  It draws lines between points and makes certain parts of the map look screwy if there are islands.
- Still no support in Bokeh for interactive stacked histograms.  Maybe use Numpy?

####Python Metrics:
A sandbox for writing different econometric models from scratch in python and improving the support for different kinds of estimation.

Needed improvements:
- Fixed effects model still does not work for an unbalanced panel, nor for clustered standard errors.
